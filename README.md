Compiler for a small programming language

- Implemented an end-to-end compiler containing scanner, recursive descent parser and an abstract syntax tree (visitor pattern) for a small programming language.
- This language had a predefined lexical structure and context-free grammar and had Java bytecode as its target language. 
- The project was implemented in Java and ASM bytecode framework was used for code generation.
